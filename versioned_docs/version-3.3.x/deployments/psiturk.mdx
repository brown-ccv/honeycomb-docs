While Honeycomb is optimized for use on a [local application](local_application), we added functionality for usage with [PsiTurk](https://psiturk.org/). The application will detect if it's being used in a Turk environment and will save the data to the default PsiTurk SQLite database.

### Prebuilt version

When a GitHub Action is run, a PsiTurk build will be created automatically, and can be downloaded from its artifacts. The workflows responsible for building the PsiTurk application are `.github/workflows/package.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The first one has to be triggered manually, the latter is triggered when you tag a release.

If this is all you need, the build instructions below can be skipped!

### Build instructions

To set up your PsiTurk project, we provide a script that does the conversion.
PsiTurk is a Python package used to manage HITs in Mechanical Turk. Before using the provided script, install [PsiTurk](https://psiturk.org/).

You'll need to follow these steps (the path to the PsiTurk project should be a directory you wish to be created):

- Build the application: `npm run build`
- Move to the `psiturkit` directory: `cd psiturkit`
- If it's the first time you're running the script:

  ```shell
  ./psiturk-it -p <PATH_TO_NEW_PSITURK_PROJECT>
  ```

- To update an existing PsiTurk project (the path to the PsiTurk project should already exist from the previous steps):

  ```shell
  ./psiturk-it -U -p <PATH_TO_NEW_PSITURK_PROJECT>
  ```

### Running PsiTurk

After that, just navigate to your newly created PsiTurk project directory.

```shell
shell> psiturk # start psiturk
psiturk> server on # start server
psiturk> debug # enter debug mode
```
