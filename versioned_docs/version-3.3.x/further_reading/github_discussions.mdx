The [Honeycomb repository](https://github.com/brown-ccv/honeycomb) includes a [discussions](https://github.com/brown-ccv/honeycomb/discussions) board. It is a place to ask questions, share ideas, and engage with the community! Official announcements from the project are posted to the [Announcements](https://github.com/brown-ccv/honeycomb/discussions/categories/announcements) section.

Please direct all [feature requests](https://github.com/brown-ccv/honeycomb/discussions/categories/feature-requests) and [questions](https://github.com/brown-ccv/honeycomb/discussions/categories/q-a) to the discussions board.

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs with Honeycomb should be reported directly to the [issues](https://github.com/brown-ccv/honeycomb/issues) tab of the repository. Please select "Bug report" and include as much information as possible. If you are able to provide a minimal example that reproduces the bug, that is even better!
