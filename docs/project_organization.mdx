title: Project Organization
description: Overview of Honeycomb's directory structure
---

This project directory is organized to be very modular and composable. In general, files and functions should be relatively small and self-contained, global scope should not be used (and definitely not mutated), and only the pieces of code needed for any given file should be imported. This keeps the code maintainable with clear lineage and purpose for each piece of code. Below are descriptions of the main files and folders.

## assets/

This folder contains any static files that are used by the app. Honeycomb starts with a few images used as icons for the installed applications.

## build/

The [build scripts](npm_scripts#npm-build) automatically create a `build` folder at the root of the repository and update it on subsequent builds. `build/` should be left alone!

:::caution
The build folder is in Honeycomb's `.gitignore` and as such should never be added to git
:::

## emulator_data/

{/* TODO: Link to firebase:emulators:start and save in NPM Scripts */}
This folder contains starter data for the Firebase Emulators to use while developing locally. `emulator_data/` should be left alone!

## env/

This folder contains different `.env` files used to pass environemnt variables (secrets and/or settings) into Honeycomb. Honeycomb starts with presets for common use cases and is explained in greater detail in the [Environment Variables](environment_variables) section.

## node_modules/

:::danger
`node_modules/` is written to when running `npm install` and should never be manually edited.
:::

## psiturkit/

The file `psiturk-it` inside `psiturkit/` is a bash script used to instal PsiTurk locally - see [Deploy Online](deploy_online#build-instructions) for more information. `psiturkit/` should be left alone!

## public/

The `public` directory contains files that are used as assets in the built app.

- `favicon.ico` is the small icon you can see in the browser tab.
- `index.html` is the entry point of the website
  - Changing `<title>Honeycomb</title>` will update the name you can see in the browser tab.
- `electron.js` contains all of the code related to the electron app.

### lib/

The `lib/` directory contains the files PsiTurk needs to run. Note that `index.html` references these files inside the `<script>` tags

### config/

The `config` directory contains the config files needed for the electron app. This includes the event-marker details and event codes. `version.json` keeps track of the current git commit, which Honeycomb uses to keep track of the verison of your task used for a given experiment.

## src/

This folder contains the code for the app, the vast majority of changes and code should go here.

### App.jsx

This is the starting point for the app. The `<Login>` component handles user authentication in the different use cases and the `<JsPsychExperiment>` component initializes the `jspsych` 7 experiment. This is also where communication is set up with the `electron` and `psiturk` processes.

### App.css

This is where styling for the app is housed. If colors, fonts, spacing, etc. need to be set, do it here.

### components/

This folder contains the components referenced in `App.jsx`. This includes the Honeycomb `<JsPsychExperiment>` component which connects the Honyecomb login page to your `jspsych` 7 experiment.

### language/

Any language that is displayed in the experiment should be stored in this folder. Usage of language json files allows for easy internationalization of the task (e.g. english and spanish) as well as allows for mturk specific language. This also makes it easy to re-use common phrases in many places in the task.

### config/

In the `config/` directory, there are `.js` files which contain settings for the different parts of the task. Every task should have a `main` config and a `trigger` config (assuming use of the event marker). The `main` config has all global settings for the task (such as whether it is in mturk mode or not), load the appropriate language file, and set up a default (or only) configuration object for the task. Different in-task features can be loaded from .env files and is set in the `main` config. For example, we have included some of these files in the `env` directory (e.g. `env.clinic` file enables event marker, photodiode and volume adjustment). The `trigger` config has settings specific to the event marker and uses a slightly different style of javascript as it is imported both in the React app as well as the electron process.

Other config files can be used to add settings for specific blocks or sub-sections of the experiment. Also, _note that the productId can be overwritten by the environment variable EVENT_MARKER_PRODUCT_ID_.

### lib/

The `lib/` directory contains utility functions and markup that is used in the tasks. This allows for functions and html to be re-used wherever needed. The `lib/utils.js` file contains functions that are generally useful across many tasks, whereas `lib/taskUtils.js` contains functions specific to this task.

### lib/markup

`markup` files should contain primarily templates for HTML that is used throughout the task. Typically this will be a function that takes in some parameters and then returns a string with html.

### timelines

`jspsych` uses `timelines` to control what `trials` are displayed in what order. `timelines` can contain other `timelines`, which is why there may be several files in this directory. The `main.js` file should have the timeline that is called by `App.jsx` in the `<JsPsychExperiment>` component.

### trials

`jspsych` uses `trials` as its base unit of an experiment. These trials do things such as display some stimulus or request a response.

## .github/workflows/

This folder contains different .yaml files which are used to configure the build tests (`build.yaml`) following a push and to create task executables either in a single instance (`package.yaml`) or for a full release (`release.yaml`).

## Other Files

- `package.json` contains metadata about your project, a list of the dependency needed for the project, and scripts to run tasks related to your task. The [Quick Start](quick_start#4-change-name-and-description) lists which metadata should be changed.
- `download-response-data.js` is the script used to download data stored in Firestore to your local machine.
- `version.js` is the script used to keep track of which version of the task a given experiment is using

:::danger
`package-lock.json` is written to when running `npm install` and should never be manually edited.

### Git Files

- `.gitignore` lists the folders and files that should be excluded from Git. Make sure all of your seccrets and tokens are listed here!

### Eslint Files

- `.eslintrc.js` contains the Eslint settings for Honeycomb. We recommend it's left alone but can be adjusted for personal settings.
- `.eslintignore` lists the folders and files that eslint shouldn't touch, similar to `.gitignore`.

### Prettier Files

`.prettierrc.js` contains the Prettier settings for Honeycomb. We recommend it's left alone but can be adjusted for personal settings.

## Firebase Files

- `.firebaserc` contains the name of the project Firebase should connect to. Be sure to update the default project to the one you created!
- `firebase.json` contains the Firebase settings for Honeycomb. It should be left alone!
- `firestore.indexes.json` contains the Firestore index settings for Honeycomb. It should be left alone!
- `firestore.rules` contains the Firestore rules for creating/editing data. It should be left alone!
