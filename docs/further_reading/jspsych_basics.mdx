## Assembling Trials: Functions vs. Objects

When working with Honeycomb to create experiments, users often have questions regarding the distinction between trials exported directly as Trial objects and those encapsulated within functions that output Trial objects.

In the `honeycombTrials.js` file, you'll find that some trials are exported as objects while others are enclosed within functions. During experiment execution, certain downstream trials may require access to data collected in previous trials.

Trials relying on the global `jsPsych` object to store timeline data or retrieve aggregated results from prior trials need to dynamically ingest this information during the experiment. Consequently, the `buildTrial` functions serve the purpose of assembling trials with data in the jsPsych object collected during the experiment.

For further information about the `jsPsych` global object, refer to the [jsPsych documentation](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/reference/jspsych/).
