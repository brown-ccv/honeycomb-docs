## Environment Variables

Honeycomb uses environment variables during **build** and **run** time to control the different configurations. Below we list the environment variables used by the app and indicate their properties via badges and text. Optional variables are labeled with the ![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow) badge and mandatory variables are labeled with the ![default <default-value>](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-<defaultvalue>-yellow) badge with their default value specified. The ![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue) badge indicates the variable is used during the build/compilation phase (`npm build`) while the ![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple) badge indicates the variable is used during the executable run (`npm run dev`).

### Dev Mode Only

- `ELECTRON_START_URL` ![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow): URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) where the front end of the app is being hosted - also used in `electron.js` to indicate the app is running in dev mode.

### Desktop Only

- `EVENT_MARKER_PRODUCT_ID`![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow)![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple): The product ID of the event marker (e.g. `0487`).  If not set, it will use the `productID` set in `public/config/trigger.js` if available, or attempt to connect using the com name.
- `EVENT_MARKER_COM_NAME` ![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow)![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple): The com name of the event marker (e.g. `COM3`). If not set, it will use the `comName` set in `public/config/trigger.js`.  If the `productID` is set (not an empty string), this field will be ignored.
- `REACT_APP_VIDEO`![boolean](https://img.shields.io/badge/-boolean-lightgrey)![default false](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-false-yellow)![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue): whether the participant is being video recorded. This can be used when the task is running as a desktop app (electron).
- `REACT_APP_USE_EEG`![boolean](https://img.shields.io/badge/-boolean-lightgrey)![default false](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-false-yellow)![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue): whether the event marker/EEG is available. This can be used when the task is running as a desktop app (electron).
- `REACT_APP_USE_PHOTODIODE`![boolean](https://img.shields.io/badge/-boolean-lightgrey)![default false](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-false-yellow)![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue): whether the photodiode is in use. This can be used when the task is running as a desktop app (electron).

### Desktop and Online

- `REACT_APP_VOLUME`![boolean](https://img.shields.io/badge/-boolean-lightgrey)![default false](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-false-yellow)![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue): whether the participant is being asked to adjust volume. This can be used on both the desktop (electron) and online settings.
- `REACT_APP_PARTICIPANT_ID` ![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow)![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple): The default participant id to show when authorizing a participant. If not set, user will need to enter the value in the provided input box.
- `REACT_APP_STUDY_ID` ![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow)![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple): The default study id to show when authorizing a participant. If not set, user will need to enter the value in the provided input box.

### Understanding Build Time and Run Time Variables

- ![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple): Run-time environment variables allow for quick changes before running the task. They are convenient since they don't require building a whole different executable. For a Desktop Application, these are set at the system level and must be available at the time where the task runs. See [this tutorial for OS specific instructions.](https://www.imatest.com/docs/editing-system-environment-variables/#Windows). For a Firebase Application, these must be stored in the Firestore.

- ![build time](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue): Build-time environment variable are configured before the application is built and cannot be changed at run-time. They are configured via `.env` files before building. Instead of using a single `.env` file, we prefer to defined separate files under the `env/` directory, and use a package called `dotenv-cli` before building`.

The `dotenv-cli` comes with the `dotenv` command that can be used to properly load the needed variables. This command does not run directly from the command line (terminal). Instead, to set build-time environment variables, we need to add a  script to `package.json` with the following format:

```json
"[build|dev]:<script name>": "dotenv -e env/<your env file> npm run [build|dev]"
```

Honeycomb includes so scripts for common scenarios. For instance, you can run:

``` console
npm run dev:home
```

``` console
npm run dev:home:video
```

``` console
npm run dev:clinic
```

``` console
npm run dev:clinic:video
```

``` console
npm run dev:firebase
```
