## Creating Your Task Repository

The Honeycomb repository is a template and serves as the starting point for all tasks. Creating your repository from the template starts your project with the same directory structure and files as an existing repository.

1. Go to the [Honeycomb repository](https://github.com/brown-ccv/honeycomb)
2. Click on `Use this template` and select `Create a new repository`.
   ![Use this template](/assets/template_0.png)
3. Enter the owner, name, and description of your repository and click on `Create repository from template`.
   ![Create repository](/assets/template_1.png)
   :::note
   We recommend creating a public repository and leaving `Include all branches` unchecked
   :::
4. Ensure the repository's workflow permissions are set to "Read and write permissions"

   _`Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions`_

   <img
     src={workflowPermissions}
     alt="GitHub workflow permissions settings"
   />

_Additional details about template repositories can be found on the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)._

## Cloning the Repository

With the repository now setup it can be cloned onto your computer.

1.  Navigate to the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com).
2.  Click the `Code` button and copy the URL

    <img
      src={cloneCodeButton}
      alt="GitHub clone repo button"
    />

3.  Open a terminal and navigate to where you want the cloned directory

<Tabs groupId='os' queryString defaultValue='mac'>
<TabItem
  value='win'
  label='Windows'
>

```shell title="Powershell"
cd 'path/to/directory'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem
  value='mac'
  label='macOS'
>

```shell title="Terminal.app"
cd 'path/to/directory'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

4. Clone the repo with the following command

```shell title='Paste the URL you copied earlier'
 git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<YOUR-REPOSITORY>
```

:::note
Git can be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if it is not already on your system.
:::

_Additional details and alternative methods for cloning a repository can be found on the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=webui)._

## Installing Prerequisites

All of the needed programs for Honeycomb must be installed before we can develop our task. We will use a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) to automatically install them.

See [Prerequisites](prerequisites) for more information about these programs.

### Initial Install

<Tabs groupId='os' queryString defaultValue='mac'>
<TabItem
  value='win'
  label='Windows'
>

1. Run Powershell as an admin from the start menu

   ![Powershell admin launcher](/assets/powershell_admin.png)

2. Navigate to the root directory of your cloned repository
3. Paste the following command and follow the prompts to install the listed programs:

   ```shell
   ./winget.ps1
   ```

4. The "Visual Studio Installer" will open a GUI during installation. Make sure "Desktop Development with C++" is checked before continuing.

</TabItem>
<TabItem
  value='mac'
  label='macOS'
>

The most commonly used package manager on macOS is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

1.  Paste the following command in a macOS Terminal and follow the prompts to install Homebrew.

    ```shell
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2.  Paste the following command and follow the prompts to install the listed programs:

    ```shell
    brew bundle
    ```

3.  Install Xcode (not available on Homebrew)

    ```shell
    xcode-select --install
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
If you are running into issues after installing the packages, please restart your terminal and/or reboot your computer. This should resolve most issues.
:::

### Setting Up Node

NVM (Node Version Manager) is a tool for installing and using multiple versions on Node on your computer. It must first be installed:

1.  Install NVM

    <Tabs
      groupId="os"
      queryString
      defaultValue="mac"
    >
      <TabItem
        value="win"
        label="Windows"
      >
        <em>
          The previous step installs{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows">NVM for Windows</a> via the winget
          package manager. Note that this is a different tool than NVM with slight differences
          needed for compatibility with Windows.
        </em>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem
        value="mac"
        label="macOS"
      >
        <CodeBlock language="sh">
          curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
        </CodeBlock>
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2.  Copy the version number listed in `.nvmrc`.

    <img
      src={nvmrc}
      alt=".nvmrc file"
    />

3.  Install that version.

    ```shell
    nvm install <VERSION>
    ```

4.  Use the needed version.

    ```shell
    nvm use <VERSION>
    ```

5.  Set the current version as your default

    ```shell
    nvm alias default node
    ```

    :::note
    You can skip this step if you've already set a default node version in a different project.
    :::

## Install Dependencies

There are many Node packages used by Honeycomb that also need to be installed. Node comes with its own package manager to install, update, and maintain these dependencies throughout the development lifecycle.

```shell title="Install Honeycomb's dependencies"
npm install
```

Certain Node dependencies are best installed globally. These tools will be available from the command line anywhere on your system.

```shell title="Install Honeycomb's global dependencies"
npm install -g electron firebase-tools dotenv-cli electron lint-staged
```

## Run the Task

```shell title="Run the task in development mode"
npm run dev
```

Running the task in development mode enables "hot reloading": changes to the code will immediately be reflected in the app without needing to restart the server.

:::tip
The dev script runs Honeycomb on Electron without any environment variables. Check out the [NPM Scripts](npm_scripts#dev) page for more information on the available development environments.
:::

:::note
Honeycomb ships with a modified version of the "simple reaction time task" from the [jsPsych tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/tutorials/rt-task/). In the next section we'll create a new task and tell Honeycomb to run it!
:::

## Edit the Task

Now that the project is up and running we can make our first changes to the code!

:::info
The quick start guide details a [command line](version_control#git-commands) workflow for version control. If you are unfamiliar with Git, we recommend reading the linked page before proceeding.
:::

### 1) Edit the Project Metadata

1. Create a new branch in a separate terminal

   ```shell title="Create the branch edit-package-json"
   git checkout -b edit-package-json
   ```

2. Open `package.json` and edit it to reflect your app:

   1. `name` is your task's name, generally this is the name of our repository
   2. `description` should be rewritten to better match your task
   3. `author` is your lab (or PIs) name, email, and website
   4. `honeycombVersion` is the number currently in the `version` field
   5. `version` should then be reset to 1.0.0
   6. `repository` is the link the GitHub repository you created [earlier](#2-start-your-new-task-from-our-template-repository).

   ```json title="package.json"
   {
      "name": "my-task",
      "description": "A custom task for the Honeycomb platform",
      "author": {
        "name": "My Lab",
        "email": "example@domain.com",
        "url": "https://lab-web-page.com"
      },
      "honeycombVersion": "3.3.0", // Match what was in version!
      // highlight-delete-next-line
      "version": "3.3.0",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "repository": "https://github.com/my-username/my-repository"
   },
   ```

3. Save your changes and commit them to git:

   ```shell title="Commit all changed files with a custom message"
   git commit -a -m "edit package.json with my task's information"
   ```

4. Create and merge a [pull request](version_control#create-a-pull-request) to merge your changes into the `main` branch. Make sure the builds complete successfully before merging!

### 2) Add a file for the task

1. Bring your branch up to date with the `main` branch

   ```shell title="Switch to the main branch"
   git checkout main
   ```

   ```shell title="Bring changes from GitHub into your local repository"
   git pull
   ```

2. Create a new branch (replace `task-name` with the name of your task)

   ```shell title="Check out a new branch"
   git checkout -b add-<task-name>-file
   ```

3. Add a new file inside `src/experiment/` with the same name as your task
4. Save your changes and commit them to git:

   ```shell title="Add the new file to Git"
   git add .
   ```

   ```shell title="Commit all changed files with a custom message"
   git commit -a -m "feat: adds file for the <task name> task"
   ```

5. Add a `taskNameOptions` object to the new file (replace `taskName` with the name of your task)

   ```javascript title="taskName.js"
   /**
    * Experiment-wide settings for jsPsych: https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/overview/experiment-options/
    * Note that Honeycomb combines these with other options required for Honeycomb to operate correctly
    */
   export const taskNameOptions = {
     // Called when every trial finishes
     on_trial_finish: function (data) {
       console.log(`Trial ${data.internal_node_id} just finished:`, data);
     },
     // Called when the experiment finishes
     on_finish: function (data) {
       console.log("The experiment has finished:", data);
       // Reload the page for another run-through of the experiment
       window.location.reload();
     },
   };
   ```

6. Add a `buildTaskNameFunction` to the new file (replace `TaskName` with the name of your task)

   ```javascript title="taskName.js"
   /**
    * This timeline builds the example reaction time task from the jsPsych tutorial.
    * Take a look at how the code here compares to the jsPsych documentation!
    * See the jsPsych documentation for more: https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/tutorials/rt-task/
    *
    * @param {Object} jsPsych The jsPsych instance being used to run the task
    * @returns {Object} A jsPsych timeline object
    */
   export function buildTaskNameTimeline(jsPsych) {}
   ```

7. Save your changes and commit them to git:

   ```shell title="Commit all changed files with a custom message"
   git commit -a -m "feat: adds taskNameOptions and buildTaskNameTimeline to taskName.js"
   ```

8. Edit `src/experiment/index.js` to use the new file

   ```js title="src/experiment/index.js"
   // highlight-delete-next-line
   import { buildHoneycombTimeline, honeycombOptions } from "./honeycomb";
   import { buildTaskNameTimeline, taskNameOptions } from "./taskName";

   // ...

   // highlight-delete-next-line
   export const jsPsychOptions = honeycombOptions;
   export const jsPsychOptions = taskNameOptions;

   // ...

   export function buildTimeline(jsPsych, studyID, participantID) {
     console.log(`Building timeline for participant ${participantID} on study ${studyID}`);

     // highlight-delete-next-line
     const timeline = buildHoneycombTimeline(jsPsych);
     const timeline = buildTaskNameTimeline(jsPsych);
     return timeline;
   }
   ```

9. Run the format script to make sure the code is formatted correctly

   ```shell
   npm run format
   ```

10. Save your changes and commit them to git:

    ```shell title="Commit all changed files with a custom message"
    git commit -a -m "fix: Use new task's file"
    ```

11. Create and merge a [pull request](version_control#create-a-pull-request) to merge your changes into the `main` branch. Make sure the builds complete successfully before merging!

### 3) Add some trials to the task

1. Bring your branch up to date with the `main` branch

   ```shell title="Switch to the main branch"
   git checkout main
   ```

   ```shell title="Bring changes from GitHub into your local repository"
   git pull
   ```

2. Create a new branch

   ```shell title="Bring changes from GitHub into your local repository"
   git checkout -b add-start-procedure
   ```

3. Add the start procedure to the `buildTaskNameTimeline` function in the file you created earlier

   ```javascript title="taskName.js"
   import { buildStartProcedure } from "./procedures/startProcedure";

   // ...

   export function buildTaskNameTimeline(jsPsych) {
     // Build the trials that make up the start procedure
     const startProcedure = buildStartProcedure(jsPsych);

     const timeline = [startProcedure];
     return timeline;
   }

   // ...
   ```

4. Save your changes and commit them to git:

   ```shell title="Commit all changed files with a custom message"
   git commit -a -m "feat: adds startProcedure to the task"
   ```

5. Edit the text for the task's name
   ```json title="src/config/language.json"
   {
     "name": "taskName"
     // ...
   }
   ```
   :::tip
   The text for the introduction trial is in `src/config/language.json` under the `trials` and `introduction` key.
   ```json title="src/config/language.json"
    {
      "name": "taskName"
      // ...
      "trials": {
        "introduction": "Welcome to the experiment. Press any key to begin."
        // ...
      },
      // ...
    }
   ```
   :::
6. Save your changes and commit them to git:

   ```shell title="Commit all changed files with a custom message"
   git commit -a -m "feat: Updates the language for the startProcedure of the task"
   ```

7. Add the end procedure to the `buildTaskNameTimeline` function in the file you created earlier

   ```javascript title="taskName.js"
   import { buildStartProcedure } from "./procedures/startProcedure";
   import { buildEndProcedure } from "./procedures/endProcedure";

   // ...

   export function buildTaskNameTimeline(jsPsych) {
     // Build the trials that make up the start procedure
     const startProcedure = buildStartProcedure(jsPsych);

     // Builds the trials that make up the end procedure
     const endProcedure = buildEndProcedure(jsPsych);

     const timeline = [startProcedure, endProcedure];
     return timeline;
   }
   // ...
   ```

   :::tip
   The text for the conclusion trial is in `src/config/language.json` under the `trials` and `conclusion` key.

   ```json title="src/config/language.json"
    {
      "name": "taskName"
      // ...
      "trials": {
        // ...
        "conclusion": "Welcome to the experiment. Press any key to begin."
      },
    }
   ```

   :::

8. Run a format to make sure the code is formatted correctly

   ```shell
   npm run format
   ```

9. Save your changes and commit them to git:

   ```shell title="Commit all changed files with a custom message"
   git commit -a -m "feat: adds endProcedure to the task"
   ```

10. Create and merge a [pull request](version_control#create-a-pull-request) to merge your changes into the `main` branch. Make sure the builds complete successfully before merging!
