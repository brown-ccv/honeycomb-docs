It is important that your computer is set up with the necessary packages before you begin development. You will come across a variety of errors if these prerequisites are not installed. **The [quick start](quick_start#installing-prerequisites) guide explains how to run an automated install**, this page details what programs and packages are needed to run and build Honeycomb. There are some OS specific prerequisites needed to build a task as a desktop application.

## OS Independent

### Git

[git](https://git-scm.com) is an open source version control system. It is used to track changes, revert mistakes, and enable peer code reviews!

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) is a GUI application used to interact with git and GitHub directly from your computer. It is not strictly needed but many folks find it easier to work with then using git directly from the command line.

### Node JS

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) is a cross-platform runtime environment for JavaScript code. Almost every web application today builds on top of node.

Note Honeycomb needs version 16 or later to run - the installers run the long term support (LTS) version. This is version 18 as of June 2023

### Python

[Python](https://www.python.org) is a high-level programming language. Some "under the hood" tools needed by Honeycomb are written in python so it must be installed on your system.

Note Honeycomb needs version 3.7 or later to run - the installers use version 3.11.

### Oracle JDk

[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/) is another high-level programming languages that some tools (Namely the Firebase Emulators) are written in. We must install a JDK (Java Development Kit) for it to run.

Note Honeycomb needs version 11 or later to run - the installers use version 18.

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a well-loved and easy to use integrated development environment (IDE). This is the program you'll use to write your task.

## Mac Specific Installs

### X-Code

[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is a special IDE for the Apple platform. It comes with everything needed to compile desktop applications from an Apple computer. It must be installed from the terminal:

```shell title="Installing XCode"
  xcode-select --install
```

### Rosetta

Rosetta is a translation layer built for Mac computers with Apple Silicon. It should ask to be installed if any of the prerequisite tools need it. Otherwise, [this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) can be used to make sure it is on your apple silicon system.

## Windows Specific Install

### Visual Studio

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) is a special IDE for the Windows platform. It comes with everything needed to compile desktop applications from a PC. Visual Studio Community is a free to use platform.

The "Desktop development with C++" workload must also be installed on your system. The automated installers will do so.

## Manual Installation (macOS)

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

  - Install the [Native C++ Workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160#step-4---choose-workloads-1)

## Manual Installation (Linux)

The links below will take you to each project installation page should you prefer to manually install the prerequisite software. Your preferred installation method for the programs listed [above](#os-independent) should get you up and running on any Linux distro new enough to support GLIBC_2.28.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - We recommend installing the "LTS" option for better stability
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
- [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-linux)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) or follow installation instructions on the [electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-linux#prerequisites)
- Development headers of `GTK 3` and `libnotify` (Follow installation instructions on the [electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-linux#prerequisites))

### Python on Windows (pyenv)

Installing and managing Python on Windows is a notoriously difficult task even for advanced developers. It is best practice to have exactly 1 tool for managing python on your system, which is a rule for most things in software development (this is what [npm](quick_start/#3-install-npm-packages) does for node packages). **We highly recommend uninstalling Python and using pyenv even if you never anticipate using python again.** We promise the extra setup today will pay great dividends in the future!

First and foremost, turn off both Python App Installers in the "App Execution Aliases" settings. **Please complete this step even if you already have a Python manager**

![App execution aliases](assets/python-win-1.png)
![Turn off app installer](assets/python-win-2.png)

Now we can set up our Python management system<sup>1</sup>. We recommend [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) as it is small and intuitive for newer developers. It lets us install python globally AND switch between different versions for individual projects. It does this (and only this) extremely well. Complete the following steps to install `pyenv` for Windows and set up your global Python environment:

1. Ensure Python is completely uninstalled from your system<sup>2</sup>

   - Type `python` on the command line and ensure you get a "Command 'python' not found" error

   ```powershell
   python
   ```

- _If the command executes, locate the installation (check "Add or Remove programs" in the settings) and remove it. Continue until the error appears_
- _If the Microsoft Store launches check again to ensure "Manage App execution aliases" is turned off for `python.exe` and `python3.exe`_

2. Install `pyenv-win`

   - `pyenv-win` will install with `chocolatey.config` - enter `pyenv` on the command line to see if it's already on your system. You should see a list of commands printed to your terminal.

     ```shell
     pyenv
     ```

   - If not:

     ```shell
     choco install pyenv-win
     ```

3. Install your Python version

   ```powershell
   pyenv install <version>
   ```

   - If you're using a different Python version for another project that version will work fine so long as it is at least version `> 3.0.0`
   - Otherwise, install the newest version that includes exactly 3 numbers, e.g. `3.10.6`

     ```powershell
     pyenv install --list
     ```

4. Use that version as your global install

   ```powershell
   pyenv global <version>
   ```

<sup>1</sup>_If you are already using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) for Python and its
various other tools that is okay! You already have python manager installed on your system and can
skip this section._

<sup>2</sup>_Any "solo" installations can and will cause major conflicts with `pyenv`. It can cause
issues when you try to change your version, when another program checks for Python, when you update
Windows... so on and so forth. Perhaps you've already run into something unexpected like this! This
is why it's essential python is completely uninstalled from your computer before beginning._
