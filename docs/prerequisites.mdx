It is important that your computer is set up with the necessary packages before you begin development. You will come across a variety of errors if these prerequisites are not installed. **The [quick start](quick_start#installing-prerequisites) guide explains how to run an automated install**, this page details what programs and packages are needed to run and build Honeycomb. There are some OS specific prerequisites needed to build a task as a desktop application.

## OS Independent

### Git

- git (version control)
- GitHub Desktop (GUI for managing git and GitHub)

### Node JS

- nodejs (web development - we install the latest long term support version)

### Python

- Python 3.7 or later (programming language - we install v3.11)

### Oracle JDk

- Oracle JDK (Java Development Kit - we install v19)

### Visual Studio Code

- VS Code (Integrated Development Environment)

## Mac Specific Installs

### X-Code

[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is a special IDE for the Apple platform. It comes with everything needed to compile desktop applications from an Apple computer.

must be installed from the terminal:

```terminal
  xcode-select --install
```

### Rosetta

## Windows Specific Install

### Visual Studio

[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is a special IDE for the Apple platform. It comes with everything needed to compile desktop applications from an Apple computer.

### Manual Installation (macOS)

- [Git 2.20.0 or later](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) with support for "--show-current"
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- To install Python (3.7 or later with support for TLS 1.2) follow the guide on electron docs to [install and configure python and its modules](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-macos#python)

### Manual Installation (Windows)

The links below will take you to each project installation page should you prefer to manually install the prerequisite software.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - We recommend installing the "LTS" option for better stability
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Visual Studio:
  - [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
  - Install the [Native C++ Workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160#step-4---choose-workloads-1)
- [pyenv for Windows](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation)

### Manual Installation (Linux)

The links below will take you to each project installation page should you prefer to manually install the prerequisite software. Your preferred installation method for the programs listed [above](#os-independent) should get you up and running on any Linux distro new enough to support GLIBC_2.28.

- Download the [Node.js source code](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and compile it
- [Git 2.20.0 or later](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) with support for "--show-current"
- [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (with support for TLS 1.2)
- Install [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) or follow installation instructions on the [electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-linux#prerequisites)
- Development headers of `GTK 3` and `libnotify` (Follow installation instructions on the [electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-linux#prerequisites))

## Further Help

If you are still having issues setting up your computer you can find the full instructions on the [electron documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-gn) for your specific OS.

### Python on Windows (pyenv)

Installing and managing Python on Windows is a notoriously difficult task even for advanced developers. It is best practice to have exactly 1 tool for managing python on your system, which is a rule for most things in software development (this is what [npm](quick_start/#3-install-npm-packages) does for node packages). **We highly recommend uninstalling Python and using pyenv even if you never anticipate using python again.** We promise the extra setup today will pay great dividends in the future!

First and foremost, turn off both Python App Installers in the "App Execution Aliases" settings. **Please complete this step even if you already have a Python manager**

![Turn off app installer](assets/python-win-2.png)

Now we can set up our Python management system<sup>1</sup>. We recommend [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) as it is small and intuitive for newer developers. It lets us install python globally AND switch between different versions for individual projects. It does this (and only this) extremely well. Complete the following steps to install `pyenv` for Windows and set up your global Python environment:

1. Ensure Python is completely uninstalled from your system<sup>2</sup>

   - Type `python` on the command line and ensure you get a "Command 'python' not found" error

   ```powershell
   python
   ```

- _If the command executes, locate the installation (check "Add or Remove programs" in the settings) and remove it. Continue until the error appears_
- _If the Microsoft Store launches check again to ensure "Manage App execution aliases" is turned off for `python.exe` and `python3.exe`_

2. Install `pyenv-win`

   - `pyenv-win` will install with `chocolatey.config` - enter `pyenv` on the command line to see if it's already on your system. You should see a list of commands printed to your terminal.

     ```shell
     pyenv
     ```

   - If not:

     ```shell
     choco install pyenv-win
     ```

3. Install your Python version

   ```powershell
   pyenv install <version>
   ```

   - If you're using a different Python version for another project that version will work fine so long as it is at least version `> 3.0.0`
   - Otherwise, install the newest version that includes exactly 3 numbers, e.g. `3.10.6`

     ```powershell
     pyenv install --list
     ```

4. Use that version as your global install

   ```powershell
   pyenv global <version>
   ```

<sup>1</sup>_If you are already using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) for Python and its
various other tools that is okay! You already have python manager installed on your system and can
skip this section._

<sup>2</sup>_Any "solo" installations can and will cause major conflicts with `pyenv`. It can cause
issues when you try to change your version, when another program checks for Python, when you update
Windows... so on and so forth. Perhaps you've already run into something unexpected like this! This
is why it's essential python is completely uninstalled from your computer before beginning._
