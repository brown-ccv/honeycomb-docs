title: Directory Structure
description: Overview of Honeycomb's directory structure
---

This project directory is organized to be modular and composable. In general, files and functions should be relatively small and self-contained, global scope should not be used, and only the pieces of code needed for any given file should be imported.

## assets/

This folder contains static files that are used by the application. Honeycomb uses a few images as icons for the installed applications.

:::caution
Assets that pertain to your specific task should be added to the [public/assets/](#assets-1) folder, not here!
:::

## build/

The [build scripts](npm_scripts#npm-build) automatically create a `build` folder at the root of the repository and update it on subsequent builds.

:::danger
`build/` should be left alone! It is in Honeycomb's `.gitignore` and should never be added to git.
:::

## emulator_data/

This folder contains starter data for the Firebase Emulators to use while developing locally. The [Firebase Scripts](npm_scripts#firebase) detail how to use this data.

:::danger
`emulator_data/` is written to when running `npm run firebase:emulators:save` and should never be edited.
:::

## env/

This folder contains different files used to pass environment variables (settings) into Honeycomb. Honeycomb starts with presets for common use cases and is explained in greater detail in the [Environment Variables](environment_variables) section.

## node_modules/

:::danger
`node_modules/` is written to when running `npm install` and should never be edited. It is in Honeycomb's `.gitignore` and should never be added to git.
:::

## psiturkit/

The file `psiturk-it` inside `psiturkit/` is a bash script used to instal PsiTurk locally - see [PsiTurk](psiturk#build-instructions) for more information.

:::caution
This folder involves a Honeycomb deployment. The files do not need to be edited.
:::

## public/

The `public` directory contains files that are used as assets in the built app.

- `index.html` is the entry point of the website
  - Changing `<title>Honeycomb</title>` will update the name you can see in the browser tab!
- `favicon.ico` is the small icon you can see in the browser tab
- `manifest.json` contains metadata about the web app

### assets/

The `public/assets/` directory contains all of the audio, images, and videos needed to run your task.

### electron/

The `public/electron/` directory contains the files needed to run Honeycomb as an Electron app.

- `main.js` sets up Electron itself
- `preload.js` sets up the communication between the main and renderer processes.

:::caution
This folder involves a Honeycomb deployment, the files do not need to be edited.
:::

### lib/

The `public/lib/` directory contains the files PsiTurk needs to run. Note that `index.html` references these files inside the `<script>` tags.

:::danger
This folder involves dependencies for a Honeycomb deployment, the files should not be edited.
:::

## src/

This folder contains the source code for the Honeycomb application.

### App/

Files relating to the React application.

:::caution
This folder holds the code that runs the jsPsych task, the files do not need to be edited.
:::

#### components/

The React components that make up Honeycomb are located here.

- `App.jsx` initializes and maintains the state of the application.
- `Error.jsx` displays a small error message. It is rendered when the App.jsx detects an issue in state.
- `JsPsychExperiment.jsx` initializes the jsPsych experiment.
- `Login.jsx` handles user authentication based on the environment variables passed to Honeycomb.

#### deployments/

Custom code used by the various deployments such as Firebase.

:::caution
This folder involves Honeycomb deployments, the files do not need to be edited.
:::

### config/

Each file in the config directory contains settings for a different part of the task.

- `language.json` contains the language used in your task. This file allows for easy internationalization of the task (e.g. english and spanish) and mturk-specific language. Common phrases can be written once and re-used throughout the task.
- `main.js` contains the global settings (e.g. whether Honeycomb is running online or in the clinic) passed from env variables and logic for loading the appropriate files.
- `settings.json` contains the settings for your task. Usage of the config file allows for easy updating of task settings. Common settings can be written once and re-used throughout the task.
- `trigger.js` contains equipment-related settings for a trigger box. The `eventCodes` are especially important for marking the types of given trials.

### experiment/

:::tip
This is where you'll spend most of your time when creating a new task!
:::

#### timelines/

A timeline is a collection of trials that JsPsych displays in the given order. Timelines can contain timelines themselves; you may want to break this nesting into multiple files in this folder.

- `main.js` contains the JsPsych options and root timeline which `App.jsx` uses to run the experiment.
- `honeycombBlock.js` contains the timeline for the Honeycomb block - the "meat" the example reaction-time task. It uses the task settings from [config.json](#config-1).
- `honeycombTimeline.js` contains the timeline for the entire Honeycomb task. This includes the block timeline from `honeycombBlock.js`, as well as individual trials such as the welcome screen, full screen trial, and instructions.
- `preamble.js` contains a base timeline for showing the name and welcome screen of an experiment, as well as automatically entering fullscreen mode. It adds the photodiode instructions to the timeline if Honeycomb is using the photodiode.

#### trials/

A trial is the base unit of a JsPsych experiment. Each trial should be its own file within this folder - the files in [src/timelines/](#timelines) will combine these trials into the full experiment.

- `honeycombTrials.js` contains the individual trials used in the Honeycomb task. These trials are imported into `honeycombBlock.js` and `honeycombTimeline.js`.
- `adjustVolume.js` prompts the user to adjust the volume on their computer.
- `camera.js` contains trials for beginning and ending a camera recording.
- `fullscreen.js` contains trials for entering and exiting fullscreen mode.
- `holdUpMarker.js` prompts the user to connect their event marker and hold it up to the camera.
- `quizTrial.js` contains trials for a quiz/survey.
- `startCode.js` emits a start code to a photodiode spot and audible beep

### lib/

A library of utility and markup functions are located here. This allows for functions and html to be re-used wherever needed.

- `utils.js` contains utility functions that can be used across a variety of trials. Be sure to look for functions you might be able to use in your task!

#### markup/

Markup files contain HTML templates used throughout the task.

- `photodiode.js` contains the markup for the photodiode box and spot displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen
- `tags.js` contains functions for wrapping [language](#config-1) in common html tags. You should always wrap your language in a tag to ensure it is displayed correctly.
  - For example: `p('Hello World')` will return `<p>Hello World</p>`.

:::tip
The `tag` function inside `tags.js` can be used to wrap language in any html tag you need.
:::

## Other Folders/Files

- `.nvmrc` determines which version of node that Honeycomb is designed to be run on
- `.github/workflows/` contains .yaml files used to build Honeycomb on a pull request (`build.yaml`) and create task executables either in a single instance (`package.yaml`) or for a full release (`release.yaml`)
- `package.json` contains metadata about your project, a list of the dependencies needed for the project, and scripts to run tasks related to your task. The [Quick Start](quick_start#4-change-name-and-description) lists which metadata should be changed.
- `cli.mjs` is the script used to download and delete data stored in Firestore.
- `version.js` is the script used to keep track of which version of the task a given experiment is using

:::danger
`package-lock.json` is written to when running `npm install` and should never be edited.
:::

### Firebase Files

- `.firebaserc` contains the name of the project Firebase should connect to. Be sure to update the default project to the one you created!
- `firebase.json` contains the Firebase settings for Honeycomb.
- `firestore.indexes.json` contains the Firestore index settings for Honeycomb.
- `firestore.rules` contains the Firestore rules for creating/editing data.

:::caution
`firebase.json`, `firestore.indexes.json`, and `firestore.rules` shouldn't need to be edited.
:::

### Git Files

- `.eslintignore` lists the folders and files that eslint shouldn't touch, similar to `.gitignore`.

### Prettier Files

`.prettierrc.js` contains the Prettier settings for Honeycomb. We recommend it's left alone but can be adjusted for personal settings.

### src/index.js

:::danger
`index.js` runs the Honeycomb application itself and should not be edited.
:::

Note that the id 'root' corresponds with a tag in `public/index.html`:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
