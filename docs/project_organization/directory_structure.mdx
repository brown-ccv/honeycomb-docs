description: Overview of Honeycomb's directory structure
---

This project directory is organized to be modular and composable. In general, files and functions should be relatively small and self-contained, global scope should not be used, and only the pieces of code needed for any given file should be imported.

## assets/

This folder contains static files that are used by the application. Honeycomb uses a few images as icons for the installed applications.

:::caution
Assets that pertain to your specific task should be added to the [public/assets/](#assets-1) folder, not here!
:::

## build/

The [build scripts](npm_scripts#npm-build) automatically create a `build` folder at the root of the repository and update it on subsequent builds.

:::danger
`build/` should be left alone! It is in Honeycomb's `.gitignore` and should never be added to git.
:::

## emulator_data/

This folder contains starter data for the Firebase Emulators to use while developing locally. The [Firebase Scripts](npm_scripts#firebase) detail how to use this data.

:::danger
`emulator_data/` is written to when running `npm run firebase:emulators:save` and should never be edited.
:::

## env/

This folder contains different files used to pass environment variables (settings) into Honeycomb. Honeycomb starts with presets for common use cases and is explained in greater detail in the [Environment Variables](environment_variables) section.

## node_modules/

:::danger
`node_modules/` is written to when running `npm install` and should never be edited. It is in Honeycomb's `.gitignore` and should never be added to git.
:::

## psiturkit/

The file `psiturk-it` inside `psiturkit/` is a bash script used to instal PsiTurk locally - see [PsiTurk](psiturk#build-instructions) for more information.

:::caution
This folder involves a Honeycomb deployment. The files do not need to be edited.
:::

## public/

The `public` directory contains files that are used as assets in the built app.

- `index.html` is the entry point of the website
  - Changing `<title>Honeycomb</title>` will update the name you can see in the browser tab!
- `favicon.ico` is the small icon you can see in the browser tab
- `manifest.json` contains metadata about the web app

### assets/

The `public/assets/` directory contains all of the audio, images, and videos needed to run your task.

### electron/

The `public/electron/` directory contains the files needed to run Honeycomb as an Electron app.

- `main.js` sets up Electron itself
- `preload.js` sets up the communication between the main and renderer processes.

:::caution
This folder involves a Honeycomb deployment, the files do not need to be edited.
:::

### lib/

The `public/lib/` directory contains the files PsiTurk needs to run. Note that `index.html` references these files inside the `<script>` tags.

:::danger
This folder involves dependencies for a Honeycomb deployment, the files should not be edited.
:::

## src/

This folder contains the source code for the Honeycomb application.

- `index.js` is the entry point for React in our application. Note that the id 'root' corresponds with a tag in `public/index.html`:
  ```html
  <div id="root"></div>
  ```
  :::danger
  `index.js` runs Honeycomb itself and should not be edited.
  :::

### App/

Files relating to the React application.

:::caution
This folder holds the code that runs the jsPsych task, the files do not need to be edited.
:::

#### components/

The React components that make up Honeycomb are located here.

- `App.jsx` initializes and maintains the state of the application.
- `Error.jsx` displays a small error message. It is rendered when the App.jsx detects an issue in state.
- `JsPsychExperiment.jsx` initializes the jsPsych experiment.
- `Login.jsx` handles user authentication based on the environment variables passed to Honeycomb.

#### deployments/

Custom code used by the various deployments such as Firebase.

:::caution
This folder involves Honeycomb deployments, the files do not need to be edited.
:::

### config/

Each file in the config directory contains settings for a different part of the task.

- `language.json` contains the language used in your task. This file allows for easy internationalization of the task (e.g. English and Spanish) and mturk-specific language. Common phrases can be written once and re-used throughout the task.

- `main.js` contains the global settings (e.g. whether Honeycomb is running online or in the clinic) passed from env variables and logic for loading the appropriate files.
- `settings.json` contains the settings for your task. Usage of the config file allows for easy updating of task settings. Common settings can be written once and re-used throughout the task.
- `trigger.js` contains equipment-related settings for a trigger box. The `eventCodes` are especially important for marking the types of given trials.

### experiment/

:::tip
This is where you'll spend most of your time while developing your task!
:::

- `index.js` contains the outermost logic for running the experiment. It loads experiment's styling and exports the main timeline and options for the experiment.
  :::caution
  The experiment will not run correctly if the names `jsPsychOptions` or `buildTimeline` are changed.
  :::
- `honeycomb.js` contains the options and timeline for the [jsPsych tutorial's](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/tutorials/rt-task/) "Simple React Time Task". It serves as an example for the experiment timeline for your task.
  :::tip
  This is just an example experiment! Be sure to write your experiment in its own file.
  {/* TODO: Link to this in the quick_start guide once it's ready */}
  :::

#### procedures/

A procedure is a tested timeline of trials in jsPsych. Common parameters can be used across trials, and the trials within a procedure can be ordered and repeated as desired. Check out the [JsPsych documentation](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/overview/timeline/#timeline-variables) for more information on creating a custom procedure.

- `startProcedure.js` contains the procedure for the start of the experiment. It uses the environment and task settings from [config.json](#config) to create a nested timeline that correctly starts the experiment.
- `honeycombProcedure.js` contains the procedure for the Honeycomb task. It displays a fixation dot and presents the stimulus of the example task.
  :::tip
  This is just an example procedure! Be sure to write your procedures in their own files.
  :::
- `endProcedure.js` contains the procedure for the end of the experiment. It uses the environment and task settings from [config.json](#config) to create a nested timeline that correctly end the experiment.

#### trials/

A [trial](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/overview/timeline/#a-single-trial) is the base unit of an experiment. These trials are ordered into procedures and timelines to create the task itself.

- `adjustVolume.js` prompts the user to adjust the volume on their tablet.
- `camera.js` contains trials for beginning and ending a camera recording.
- `conclusion.js` displays a message to the user indicating that the experiment has concluded.
- `fixation` displays a fixation dot in the center of the screen. It contains additional logic for flashing a photodiode spot and emitting an event code based on the environment settings.
- `fullscreen.js` contains trials for entering and exiting fullscreen mode.
- `holdUpMarker.js` prompts the user to connect their event marker and hold it up to the camera.
- `honeycombTrials.js` contains the individual trials used in the Honeycomb task. These trials are imported into `experiment/procedures/honeycombProcedure.js` and `experiment/honeycomb.js`.
  :::tip
  These trials are for an example experiment! Be sure to write trials pertaining to your task in their own file(s).
  :::
- `introduction.js` displays a message to the user welcoming them to the experiment. They must click on a button to continue.
- `name.js` displays the name of the task to the user.
- `startCode.js` emits a start code to a photodiode spot and audible beep.

- `survey.js` contains trials pertaining to a survey/quiz for the user to complete.

### lib/

A library of utility and markup functions are located here. This allows for functions and html to be re-used wherever needed.

- `utils.js` contains utility functions that can be used across a variety of trials. Be sure to look for functions you might be able to use in your task!

#### markup/

Markup files contain HTML templates used throughout the task.

- `photodiode.js` contains the markup for the photodiode box and spot displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen
- `tags.js` contains functions for wrapping [language](#config-1) in common html tags. You should always wrap your language in a tag to ensure it is displayed correctly.
  - For example: `p('Hello World')` will return `<p>Hello World</p>`.

:::tip
The `tag` function inside `tags.js` can be used to wrap language in any html tag you need.
