description: Overview of environment variables used by Honeycomb

{/* TODO: Pull the environment variables into their own constants? */}

Honeycomb uses environment variables to control the different configurations. Below we list the environment variables used by the app and indicate their properties via badges and text.

- Optional variables are labeled with the ![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow) badge
- Mandatory variables are labeled with the ![default <value>](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-<defaultvalue>-yellow) badge and specify their default values.

{/* TODO: Table of environment variables */}

## Understanding the Environment Variables

### Run-time

The ![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple) badge indicates the variable is set/determined each time the executable is run (`npm run dev`). Run-time environment variables allow for quick changes before running the task. They are convenient since they don't require building a whole different executable.

- Desktop deployments must set these environment variables at the system level.
  - See [this tutorial for OS specific instructions.](https://www.imatest.com/docs/editing-system-environment-variables/#Windows).
- Online deployments must use Firebase, and store the runtime environment variables in Firestore.

### Build-time

The ![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue) badge indicates the variable is set during the build phase (`npm build`) Build-time environment variables are configured before the application is built and cannot be changed at run-time. These variables are configured via `.env` files in the [env](directory_structure#env) folder.

### Setting Build-time Environment Variables

The `dotenv-cli` comes with the `dotenv` command that can be used to properly load the needed variables. We write our npm scripts with the following format:

```json title="package.json"
"[build|dev]:<env name>": "dotenv -e env/<env name> npm run [build|dev]:<env name>"
```

_See [NPM Scripts](npm_scripts) for more_

Note that certain variables are only used in the desktop version of the app, while others are only used in the online version. The following table indicates which variables are used in which version:

### Dev Mode Only

- `ELECTRON_START_URL` ![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow): URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) where the front end of the app is being hosted - also used in `electron.js` to indicate the app is running in dev mode.

## Desktop Only

- `EVENT_MARKER_PRODUCT_ID`![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow)![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple): The product ID of the event marker (e.g. `0487`). If not set, it will use the `productID` set in `public/config/trigger.js` if available, or attempt to connect using the com name.
- `EVENT_MARKER_COM_NAME` ![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow)![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple): The com name of the event marker (e.g. `COM3`). If not set, it will use the `comName` set in `public/config/trigger.js`. If the `productID` is set (not an empty string), this field will be ignored.
- `REACT_APP_VIDEO`![boolean](https://img.shields.io/badge/-boolean-lightgrey)![default false](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-false-yellow)![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue): whether the participant is being video recorded. This can be used when the task is running as a desktop app (electron).
- `REACT_APP_USE_EEG`![boolean](https://img.shields.io/badge/-boolean-lightgrey)![default false](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-false-yellow)![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue): whether the event marker/EEG is available. This can be used when the task is running as a desktop app (electron).
- `REACT_APP_USE_PHOTODIODE`![boolean](https://img.shields.io/badge/-boolean-lightgrey)![default false](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-false-yellow)![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue): whether the photodiode is in use. This can be used when the task is running as a desktop app (electron).

## Desktop and Online

- `REACT_APP_VOLUME`![boolean](https://img.shields.io/badge/-boolean-lightgrey)![default false](https://img.shields.io/badge/default-false-yellow)![buildtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-buildtime-blue): whether the participant is being asked to adjust volume. This can be used on both the desktop (electron) and online settings.
- `REACT_APP_PARTICIPANT_ID` ![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow)![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple): The default participant id to show when authorizing a participant. If not set, user will need to enter the value in the provided input box.
- `REACT_APP_STUDY_ID` ![string](https://img.shields.io/badge/-string-grey)![optional](https://img.shields.io/badge/-optional-yellow)![runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/-runtime-purple): The default study id to show when authorizing a participant. If not set, user will need to enter the value in the provided input box.
