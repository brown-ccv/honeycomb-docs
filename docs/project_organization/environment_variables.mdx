Honeycomb uses environment variables to control the different configurations. Below we list the environment variables used by the app and indicate their properties via badges and text.

:::note
Note that Honeycomb does use other environment variables (e.g. `ELECTRON_START_URL`) but they do not effect the task itself. They can be safely ignored.

## Understanding the Environment Variables

### Run-time

The ![run](https://img.shields.io/badge/runtime-purple) badge indicates the variable is set/determined each time the executable is run (`npm run dev`). Run-time environment variables allow for quick changes before running the task. They are convenient since they don't require building a whole different executable.

- Desktop deployments must set these environment variables at the system level.
  - See [this tutorial for OS specific instructions.](https://www.imatest.com/docs/editing-system-environment-variables/#Windows).
- Online deployments must use Firebase, and store the runtime environment variables in Firestore.

### Build-time

The ![build](https://img.shields.io/badge/buildtime-blue) badge indicates the variable is set during the build phase (`npm run build`) Build-time environment variables are configured before the application is built and cannot be changed at run-time. These variables are configured via `.env` files in the [env](directory_structure#env) folder.

## Setting Build-time Environment Variables

The `dotenv-cli` comes with the `dotenv` command that can be used to properly load the needed variables. We write our npm scripts with the following format:

```json title="package.json"
"[build|dev]:<env name>": "dotenv -e env/<env name> npm run [build|dev]"
```
