To start a new task follow these steps:


### 1. Start your new task from our template repository

The simplest way to get started is creating a new repository using Honeycomb as a template.

Go to https://github.com/brown-ccv/honeycomb and click on `Use this template` on the top right. Then select the organization and the name of your repository and click on `create repository from template`

Alternatively, you can use GitHub CLI to create a new project based on the Honeycomb template repository. First, install GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com/), then simply run on your terminal: 

```
gh repo create your-new-task-name --template brown-ccv/honeycomb
``` 

You can now move into the directory that was just created

```
cd your-new-task-name
```

### 2. Change name and description

Update the `package.json` fields to reflect your app name and description, e.g. `name`, `author`, `repository`

### 3. Install the dependencies. 

You may first need to install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) before being able to use npm commands in the terminal. Then you will be able to install the dependencies for HoneyComb using

```
npm install
```

### 4. Run electron rebuild

This will build your task???????

```
npm run rebuild
```

### 5. Run the task in dev mode

To launch an electron window with the task with the inspector open to the console and will hot-reload when changes are made to the app

**For Mac and Linux:
```
npm run dev
```

**For Windows:
You will need to open 2 terminals. In the first -and make sure you are in the `task-<TASK NAME>` repo directory- run the command:

```
npm start
```

In the second terminal -  make sure you are in the `task-<TASK NAME>` repo directory-, run:

```
npm run electron-dev
```

### 6. Check out the data

The data is saved throughout the task to the users's app directory.  This is logged at the beginning of the task wherever you ran `npm run dev` (for windows, instead in two different terminals ran `npm start` and `npm run electron-dev`). It is also stored in a folder that is generated by the app, which should be found on the desktop.

### To Quit The Task
If you want to quit in the middle of the task, you can use these keyboard shortcuts:
```
Ctrl+W (for PC/Windows)
```
```
Cmd+Q (for Mac)
```
Partial data will be saved.
