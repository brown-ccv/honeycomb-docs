A major feature of Honeycomb is the ability to bundle JsPsych tasks into applications that can be run on any computer in a lab or clinic. Installers for these applications can be created for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The applications can be run without an internet connection, and do not require any additional software to be installed on the computer.

Installers for these application can be created on demand and/or automatically when a new release is created. This is called "Continuous Deployment" - more information about Honeycomb's CI/CD workflow can be found here [here](ci).

## Building the executables

Honeycomb includes workflows to build and create installers for Windows, Mac and Linux. These workflows exist for two configurations of the tasks:

- `Home`: The app does not expect event code triggers and photodiode spots.
- `Clinic`: The app expects event code triggers and photodiode spots.

:::tip
Event code triggers and photodiode spots can only be used on local applications! They will not appear when Honeycomb is deployed on the web.

More specifically, the following workflows are included:

- `build.yaml`: Every time an Pull Request (PR) is opened, or a push is made to the `main` branch, the software is built and tests are run for all platforms with `home` and `clinic` settings. This workflow does not upload desktop installers
- `package.yaml`: Create installers for any/all platforms for the `home` and `clinic` setting on demand <sup>1</sup>. The installers/executables are uploaded as artifacts and are available for download from the GitHub Actions tab. This also builds a PsiTurk version when linux or all operating systems are selected.
- `release.yml`: Every time a Tag is released, installers are created and uploaded as packages. This also builds a PsiTurk version, and deploys to GitHub pages a web version of the application.

<sup>1</sup> On-demand workflows are triggered manually from the GitHub Actions tab. Each GitHub organization/individual
has a quota on storage in private repositories. Uploading artifacts counts against your quota. You may
consider configuring your workflows to only upload what you need. You can learn more about GitHub's storage
limits in their [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#about-billing-for-github-actions).

### Download your bundled executable to install and run your task

You can download the executable file from either the tagged release page or the GitHub actions page. To install, unzip the downloaded file, install, and run.

The executable does not require installation of any additional software.
