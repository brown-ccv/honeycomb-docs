The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow will automatically deploy your task to GitHub pages if you have it enabled for your repository. It uploads the built website to the `gh-pages` branch. You can then access your task at `<github user>.github.io/<repository>`.

Session data is downloaded to the user's local machine upon completion of the experiment when using GH Pages. Because of this, GH Pages is not suitable for fully online experiments.

### Setup

Please follow the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) for setting up GH Pages on your repository and make sure the [publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) for your repository is configured for `gh-pages` branch.
