title: Set up Firebase

Honeycomb comes with methods and configurations for easy [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) set up. Please use this section to configure [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) services and Firestore cloud storage.

## Setting up Firebase

### 0. Installing the Firebase Command Line Interface

To check if firebase has been installed, type `firebase` into a terminal window.

```shell
firebase
```

If a list of options are printed on the terminal then the firebase tool has already been installed. If not, you will get an error - something along the lines of "Command not found." The firebase-cli can then be installed using npm:

```shell
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

_The `-g` flag installs an npm package globally on your system, as opposed to the current project_

### 1. Initializing firebase account and project

- Create and login to a firebase account on [the Firebase website](https://firebase.google.com/).
- Create a firebase project by clicking add project and enter a Project Name.

### 2. Linking firebase to task

- Login to firebase using `firebase login` command in the terminal.
- Navigate to the `.firebaserc` file home directory and edit the `"default"` field with the project name given in part 1.

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "<your project name>"
  }
}
```

### 3. Copying web app credentials

- Navigate to the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and select the project.
- Create a new Web App by clicking on `Add App` or the `</>` code symbol and following the prompts.
- Enter the a name for the Firebase app (could be the same as your Honeycomb task repo name).
- Check "Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app."
- Click `Register App`. This should auto-generate a script with several values that you need to copy into the next step.
- Copy the auto-generated values from the Firebase console to the corresponding variables in the `.env.firebase` file in the `env` folder of your Honeycomb task repo:

```text
REACT_APP_FIREBASE="true"
REACT_APP_apiKey=
REACT_APP_authDomain=
REACT_APP_projectId=
REACT_APP_storageBucket=
REACT_APP_messagingSenderId=
REACT_APP_appId=
```

- Copy the auto-generated values from the Firebase console to the corresponding variables in the `.env.firebase` you just created.
  - You only need to copy the variables referenced here. _If you enabled Google Analytics during project creation, additional variables may be printed in the console. You don't need to copy those._

Firebase is now set up!

## Setting up Firestore

Honeycomb includes cloud storage for task data using Firestore. Follow these steps to initialize Firestore:

- Navigate to the current project in the developer console and select `Firestore Database` from the sidebar.
- Click `Create Database`, select `production mode` and choose the current location for the cloud storage bucket.

### Firestore security rules

[Firestore Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) provides easy server-side authorization to the database. For a honeycomb task, we use the security rules to allow access to only authorized participants for a specified study. Honeycomb's default set of rules is included in the `firestore.rules` file in the home directory. This file can be edited to change the rules. To deploy the rules in the file, type the following line of code in the terminal:

```shell
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

Alternatively, editing the rules directly in the console is also possible. To do so, navigate to the `Rules` tab in the `Firestore Database` section from the firebase console sidebar then copy and paste the code that is in the `firestore.rules` file.


Firestore database and rules are now both deployed. For Honeycomb's default set of rules, to add an authorized participant for a study, create a collection named `registered_studies`, add a study with the study ID as the document name in that collection. For each registered study, add an array field named `registered_participants` where each element in the array will be an authorized participant for that study.
